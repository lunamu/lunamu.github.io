I'll be writing a series of notes on D3D book by Frank Luna. Most of these notes will be in Chinese or English. The most valuable thing that the book provided is actually the framework source code itself. Most of the code is just self-description, but it really took some time to get to understand everything in it. Let's walk these code through in detail.
Note that mostly I'm just checking the meaning of each code snippet from various sources, which saves time for you and a future me.

## d3dUtil.h:

### d3dSetDebugName

```cpp
inline void d3dSetDebugName(IDXGIObject* obj, const char* name)
{
    if(obj)
    {
        obj->SetPrivateData(WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName, lstrlenA(name), name);
    }
}
```
DXGI objects have a Guid. The GUID data type is a text string representing a Class identifier. According to MSDN, COM must be able to convert the string to a valid Class ID. All GUIDs must be authored in uppercase.
We see in MSDN that:
```cpp
HRESULT SetPrivateData(
  [in]                 REFGUID guid,
  [in]                 UINT    DataSize,
  [in, optional] const void    *pData
);
```
MSDN:The debug layer reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface pointers along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "<unnamed>". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface pointer caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName GUID that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:

```cpp
static const char c_szName[] = "My name";
hr = pContext->SetPrivateData( WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );
```

### AnsiToWString
```cpp
inline std::wstring AnsiToWString(const std::string& str)
{
    WCHAR buffer[512];
    MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, str.c_str(), -1, buffer, 512);
    return std::wstring(buffer);
}
```
MSDN: *MultiByteToWideChar* Maps a character string to a UTF-16 (wide character) string. The character string is not necessarily from a multibyte character set.


### d3dUtil Class
```cpp
class d3dUtil
{
public:
    static bool IsKeyDown(int vkeyCode);
    static std::string ToString(HRESULT hr);
    static UINT CalcConstantBufferByteSize(UINT byteSize)
    {        
        return (byteSize + 255) & ~255;
    }
    static Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3DBlob> LoadBinary(const std::wstring& filename);
    static Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3D12Resource> CreateDefaultBuffer(
        ID3D12Device* device,
        ID3D12GraphicsCommandList* cmdList,
        const void* initData,
        UINT64 byteSize,
        Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3D12Resource>& uploadBuffer);
	static Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3DBlob> CompileShader(
		const std::wstring& filename,
		const D3D_SHADER_MACRO* defines,
		const std::string& entrypoint,
		const std::string& target);
};
```
Notice that they are all static util functions.
#### Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr


d3dApp.h:

The framework is an example of singleton design pattern. This file defines the base class of every D3D app that will be created in the future.
